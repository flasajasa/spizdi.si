## Who We Are

spizdi.si is an independent accessories brand built around a very specific feeling: that quiet, controlled "fuck off".

Not rage. Not chaos. Not rudeness.
Just annoyance — calm, intentional, and unapologetic.

Represented by an annoyed bunny who isn't angry, isn't loud, and definitely isn't explaining itself.

We create pieces for people who:
- don't want attention
- don't owe explanations
- don't need to perform friendliness

The bunny isn't mad. It's done engaging.

## What We Stand For

**Boundaries are attractive**
Saying nothing can be stronger than saying everything.

**Annoyance ≠ aggression**
There's power in calm refusal.

**Minimal, with meaning**
Every detail exists for a reason — no filler, no noise.

## What We Do

We design clothing accessories that carry attitude quietly.

Pieces that say: *leave me alone — respectfully.*

No slogans. No shouting.
Just energy.
